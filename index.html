        <h3>My time with PoE</h3>
    </div>
    <p> I have played PoE for 10 year's now. Just about from the day it came out. Of the many builds that
        I have played some stand out more than others. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Voltaxic spark<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/9D8J5AUQraeCeMItoC/giphy.gif" /></li>
        <li>Righeous fire<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cLHOLW2ODazIx4Rtfi/giphy.gif" /></li>
        <li>Carrion golems<img src="https://i.imgur.com/r4mG1LN.gif" /> </li>

    <h2>Amazing content</h2>
    <p> The campain will take you though 10 acts.</p>
    <p>After the campain you will be using maps to get all the way to end game content</p>
    <p>In side maps you will also find old league mechanics that where once seasonal content that ended up staying for
        good. Such as </p>
    <div class="pathContent">
        <ul>
            <li>Breach</li>
            <li>Harvest</li>
            <li>Abyss</li>
            <li>blight</li>
            <p>and many more</p>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p> This is home to many players of PoE and some stop there to make money to gear more charecters. but for people
        that dont want to stop and stay inside maps they often
        go to farming pinicle bosses, some of the hardest the game has to offer.
